What my app does (2 of 5)
========================================================

My app is designed to enable persons interested in the `Iris` dataset Sepal.Width variable to perform some basic exploratory data analysis, without knowing R or any programming languages.

With a simple point and click user interface, the app allows users to bypass loading the dataset in R and quickly determine the following calculations:

- Min Sepal Width
- Max Sepal Width
- Median Sepal Width
- Average Sepal Width

Why it's helpful (3 of 5)
========================================================

My app obviates knowing the following R syntax/commands:


```r
library(datasets)
data(iris)
min(iris$Sepal.Width)
```

```
[1] 2
```

```r
max(iris$Sepal.Width)
```

```
[1] 4.4
```

```r
median(iris$Sepal.Width)
```

```
[1] 3
```

In general, when I use an app that's intuitive, I feel like this:  &#9786;

When I'm pulling my hair out trying to understand an app, I feel like this:   &#9785;

Or even this:   &#9760;
